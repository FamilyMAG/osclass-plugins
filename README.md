Ad Importer
==============

Ad importer allows you to batch import listings from other sources. That means that even if you already have classified ads website elsewhere, you can get it into Osclass in few simple steps thanks to this plugin!

So, how does it work? The plugin imports an XML file with all the information from your listings (the XML must be carefully crafted in order to work smoothly). Although weâ€™ve been testing it and it generally works well, it might not work if the XML structure is incorrect. You can read more information on our development blog. We have also included there an example.xml file that might be useful!

Remember that for any doubts you might have, you can always consult our forum or documentation.
