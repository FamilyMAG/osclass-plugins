Jobs attributes
===============

This plugin extends the fields of items to store jobs attributes such as salary, requirements, experience, and so on.

Since the version 2.2 has been altered the table structure, if you update the plugin you need to do an manualy alter, and recalculate the values of salary hour, to obtain correct results in searches.
